## ✅ Step 1: Deploy your website via GitHub Pages

Make sure your site is published via GitHub Pages.

- **User site**: `https://yourusername.github.io/`
- **Project site**: `https://yourusername.github.io/project-name/`

Set your custom domain in the repo settings or by adding a `CNAME` file to the root of your repository with the content:

```
yourdomain.com
```

---

## ✅ Step 2: Get your domain from Aruba

If you haven't already, purchase or manage your domain on [https://admin.aruba.it](https://admin.aruba.it).

---

## ✅ Step 3: Update DNS Settings on Aruba

1. Log in to Aruba's admin panel.
2. Go to:

```
Domini → [yourdomain.com] → Gestione DNS e Name Server → Modifica zona DNS
```

3. Add the following **A records** to point to GitHub Pages:

| Type | Name | Value             |
|------|------|-------------------|
| A    | @    | 185.199.108.153   |
| A    | @    | 185.199.109.153   |
| A    | @    | 185.199.110.153   |
| A    | @    | 185.199.111.153   |

4. Add a **CNAME record** so `www.yourdomain.com` redirects correctly:

| Type  | Name | Value                      |
|-------|------|----------------------------|
| CNAME | www  | yourusername.github.io.    |

> ⚠️ Don’t forget the trailing `.` after your GitHub username.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Configure your GitHub Repository

1. Go to your repository → Settings → Pages.
2. In the **Custom domain** field, enter:

```
yourdomain.com
```

3. GitHub will create a `CNAME` file automatically.
4. **Enable "Enforce HTTPS"** after DNS has propagated.

---

## ⏱️ Wait for DNS Propagation

- This can take a few hours (up to 48h).
- Use tools like [https://dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to check your domain.
- From your terminal:  
```bash
ping yourdomain.com
```

---

## 🧪 Test

Once propagated:

- Visit `https://yourdomain.com`
- Also test `https://www.yourdomain.com` to ensure CNAME redirection works.

---

## 🔁 Optional: Redirect `www` to apex domain

You can set up a redirect in GitHub Pages or via a simple HTML file in a separate repo like `www.yourdomain.com` that forwards to `yourdomain.com`.

Let me know if you’d like a template for that too!
