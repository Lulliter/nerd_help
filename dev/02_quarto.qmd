# What is Quarto and is it on my machine?
It is **not** an R packg, it's its own program to install... but RStudio (after some verison) install it as a bundled piece... 

```{r}
# reports on the full path names of an executable 
base::Sys.which("quarto")

# quarto version
quarto::quarto_version()

```

## Markdown `divs`

Rather than write out the `HTML`, you can use “fenced Div blocks”, which somewhat resemble code chunks. These Div blocks use the following syntax, where `#` denotes the ID, and `.` denotes a class. 

Example:

+ this (markdown) is = 

```markdown
::: {#hello .greeting .message style="color: red;"}
Hello **world**!
:::
```
::: {#hello .greeting .message style="color: red;"}
Hello **world**!
:::

+ to this (HTLM)

```HTML
<div id="hello" class="greeting">
  Hello world!
</div>
```

+ and this (markdown) is = 

```markdown
::: {style="color: red; border: solid black;"}
Goodbye, world.
:::
```
::: {style="color: red; border: solid black;"}
Goodbye, world.
:::

+ and to this (HTLM)

```HTML
<div style="color: red; border: solid black;">
  Goodbye, world.
</div>
```
