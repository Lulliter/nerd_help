+ an OS developed by AT&T employes at Bell Labs in the 1960s/70s
+ in 1972 it is rewritten in C programming, which made it portable. It then spread outside AT&T 
+ it still powers devises all around 
+ you can use it from the Command line or from GUI interfaces

### What are the kernell and shell?

cd ~ # /Users/luisamimmi
# go back to the "last" dir you were in !
