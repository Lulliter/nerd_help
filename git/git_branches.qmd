# Branches

## Create & checkout a branch

> "checkout" means to change the branch you are currently working on (or switch to)

```{bash}
# 1/2 create b
git branch page_col #create a new branch named "page_col"

# 2/2 then switch to b
git checkout page_col

# or 1+2/2 CREATE + SWITCH BRANCHES
git checkout -b page_col  
```

<!-- Now I see   
![Git chekout branch](./img_tools/ck_branch.png){#fig-git_ck_b} -->

## Switch to other branch 
You can also use `git switch other_branch` which is more specific 

```{bash}
git switch page_col
cat .git/HEAD # (confirms me I moved)
```

## Rename a (local) branch
It's the `-m` parameter !

+ you cannot rename a remote branch --> you delete it and re-upload it 
```{bash}
# In currently checkedout 
git branch -m better_name

# in different branch (non HEAD)
git switch master
git branch test_branch # fake one 
git branch -a  # it's there
git branch -m test_branch test_branch2
git branch -a  # yep!

```

## Push upstream a local branch 
1.  Create local branch 
2.  Switch to local branch 
3.  `git push –-set-upstream` command (the 1st time you push)
4.  Thereafter `git push` (all subsequent git push commands automatically move local branch changes up to the remote branch.)

```{bash}
# 1 Create local branch 
# 2 switch to local branch 
git switch page_col
# 3.a git push –set-upstream command (1st time)
git push  --set-upstream origin  page_col
  # check 
  git branch -a # YAY!
# 3.b git push origin (nest times )
git push origin
```


## Rename a (remote) branch
You need to 
1. Publish an existing local branch on remote
`git push -u origin local_branch`
2. So you delete old one and push up a new one from local repository  

## Merge a git branch into master 

1. List All Git Branches
2. Switch to Master
3. Merge Branch into Master
4. Push Changes (push the local changes to the remote repository so everyone working on the project can fetch the latest version.)


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
Since merging is a type of commit, it also requires a commit message. There are two ways to specify the commit message:
:::

```{bash}
# 1. List
git branch
# 2. Switch
git checkout master
# 3. The merge creates a merge commit, bringing together
    # lines of development while preserving the history of the source branch.
git merge -m "Prova di merge" page_col
# 4. Push the local changes to the remote repository
git push origin
```


## See differences b/w branches 

```{bash}
git diff master..page_col '***.qmd'Q
```


# Git Rebase 

1. take commits from a separat branch and replay (shift the change down to the tip of master) them at the end of another brabch
2. integrate recent commits without merging

* you never rebase a public branch, only a private one!
